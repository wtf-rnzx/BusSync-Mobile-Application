# BusSync Mobile Application

This application aims to benefits all the bus passengers for the development of a real-time GPS 
tracking and monitoring system using IoT devices, cloud computing and mobile 
application. This system will address the critical problem in modern transportation 
efficiency and safety most especially in buses. By gathering real-time data on the 
bus location, speed, distance, and also its estimated time intervals, this research will 
provide a precise monitoring of bus operations, reducing delays and optimizing 
route planning.
